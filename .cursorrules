## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

#### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Pre-Commit Linting
**ALWAYS run these commands before committing ANY changes:**

```bash
# Step 1: Auto-fix all possible issues
pnpm run fix-all

# Step 2: Verify everything passes
pnpm run check-all
```

**Never commit code that fails linting or formatting checks.**

#### Available Quality Commands
```bash
pnpm run format         # Format with Prettier
pnpm run lint           # ESLint (warnings allowed)
pnpm run lint:strict    # ESLint with zero warnings
pnpm run lint:fix       # Auto-fix ESLint issues
pnpm run type-check     # TypeScript validation
pnpm run check-all      # Full validation pipeline
pnpm run fix-all        # Auto-fix + validation
```

### Code Style Preferences

#### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript settings
- Prefer explicit types for function parameters and return types
- Use proper typing for React components and props
- Avoid `any` types - use `unknown` or specific types

#### React/Next.js
- Use App Router patterns (not Pages Router)
- Prefer Server Components when possible
- Use Client Components (`'use client'`) only when necessary
- Always use Next.js `<Image />` component instead of `<img>` tags
- Follow React 19 patterns and best practices

#### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Use semantic HTML elements

#### Import Organization
```typescript
// 1. Node/built-in modules
import { useState } from 'react'

// 2. External libraries  
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'

// 3. Internal modules
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'
```

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize images using Next.js `<Image />` component
- Use proper image sizes and formats (AVIF, WebP)
- Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content
- Monitor Core Web Vitals through Vercel Speed Insights

### SEO Requirements
- Maintain comprehensive meta tags in layout.tsx
- Use semantic HTML structure
- Ensure accessibility compliance (ARIA, proper headings)

## Content Guidelines

### Debugging Approach

2. Verify TypeScript errors: `pnpm run type-check`  
3. Test build process: `pnpm run build`
4. Use comprehensive checks: `pnpm run check-all`

## File Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for file names: `component-name.tsx`
- Use PascalCase for React components: `ComponentName`
- Use camelCase for utilities and hooks: `useCustomHook`

## Git Workflow
1. Create descriptive branch names: `feature/add-testimonials` or `fix/mobile-layout`
2. **ALWAYS run `pnpm run fix-all` before committing**
3. **ALWAYS run `pnpm run check-all` to verify**
4. Write clear commit messages following conventional commits
5. Test the production build before pushing: `pnpm run build`

Remember: This is a marketing website for a real business. Changes should enhance the user experience and drive inquiries while maintaining the professional, results-focused image.
