- **Team**: 100% engineers conducting research
- **Target Audience**: Research collaborators and potential clients
- **Contact**: hey@notacompany.com

### Website Purpose
- Showcase consumer economic theory research expertise
- Present co-creations as research validation
- Drive research collaboration inquiries
- Establish credibility in consumer behavior analysis

## Tech Stack - **Ultra-Optimized**

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.5.3 (App Router, Static Generation)
- **Runtime**: React 19.1.1  
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.0.2

- **Fonts**: System font stack (zero external requests)
- **Analytics**: Vercel Analytics + Speed Insights
- **Deployment**: Vercel (globally cached)

### Pages (3 total)
- `app/page.tsx`: Homepage - research lab overview
- `app/clients/page.tsx`: Past service clients showcase  
- `app/co-creations/page.tsx`: Research co-creations & exits

### Performance Targets
- **Bundle Size**: < 110kB shared JavaScript
- **LCP**: < 1.2s | **FID**: < 100ms | **CLS**: 0
- **Dependencies**: < 10 production packages
- **Build Time**: < 2 seconds

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards (MANDATORY)
```bash
# ALWAYS run before committing
pnpm run fix-all       # Auto-fix everything  
pnpm run check-all     # Verify all passes
```

### Code Style
- **TypeScript**: Strict settings, explicit types, avoid `any`
- **React/Next.js**: App Router patterns, Server Components preferred
- **Performance**: System fonts only, minimal dependencies
- **Styling**: Tailwind utility classes, mobile-first responsive

### Content Guidelines
- **Professional yet approachable** tone
- **Emphasize research expertise** and consumer behavior understanding
- **Position co-creations** as research validation, not just products
- **Focus on collaboration** and research applications

## Performance Requirements (CRITICAL)
- **System fonts only** - never add Google Fonts
- **Minimal JavaScript** - maintain ~102kB shared bundle
- **Static generation** for all pages  
- **Mobile-first responsive** design
- **Zero external font requests**

## AI Assistant Guidelines

### When Making Changes
1. **Always prioritize performance** - maintain ultra-fast loading
2. **Follow existing patterns** - consistency with current codebase  
3. **Consider mobile-first** - hamburger menu, touch-optimized
4. **Maintain SEO** - preserve comprehensive meta tags
5. **Research lab focus** - position as consumer behavior research experts

### When Updating Content
- **Research-first positioning** - emphasize consumer economic theory
- **Co-creations as validation** - research experiments, not just products
- **Professional credibility** - highlight engineering expertise in research
- **Collaboration focus** - invite research partnerships

### File Naming & Structure
- Use kebab-case: `site-header.tsx`
- PascalCase components: `SiteHeader` 
- Keep architecture simple and performant

Remember: This is a **high-performance research lab website**. All changes must enhance research credibility, drive collaboration inquiries, and maintain **unbelievably fast** loading times.
