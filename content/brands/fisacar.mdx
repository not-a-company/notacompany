Built a laggard stock optimization pipeline for Fisacar, a Portuguese automotive company with over 30 years of experience. The pipeline identifies slow-moving inventory, optimizes pricing strategies for aging stock, and automates remarketing workflows to reduce carrying costs and improve capital efficiency across their 300+ vehicle inventory.
