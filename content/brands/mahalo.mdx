Mahalo was a pioneering non-profit fundraising infrastructure platform designed to revolutionize how charitable organizations raise funds through peer-to-peer networks, providing technology that enabled individuals to fundraise on behalf of non-profits with transparency systems for tracking contributions, campaign management tools, community-building features, and impact measurement systems that reduced operational overhead and created more engaging donor experiences while demonstrating the potential for technology to transform charitable giving.
