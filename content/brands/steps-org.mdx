Steps.org is a health infrastructure platform that makes exercise accountability non-negotiable for managing depression, anxiety, and chronic stress through a dual accountability system combining financial consequences with human support. The platform integrates with Apple Health for automatic exercise tracking and operates on a pricing model where users start at $7/week and can earn down to $1/week through consistency, while accountability partners receive notifications when goals are missed, providing the structure needed to maintain daily exercise habits when willpower alone isn't enough.
