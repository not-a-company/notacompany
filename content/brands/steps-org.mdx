# Steps.org

Steps.org is a groundbreaking health infrastructure platform that makes exercise accountability non-negotiable for managing depression, anxiety, and chronic stress. The platform combines financial consequences with human support to help thousands of people maintain consistent daily exercise habits.

## The Platform

Steps operates on a dual accountability protocol where users start at $7/week and can earn down to $1/week through consistency. The system integrates with Apple Health for automatic exercise tracking and includes accountability partner notifications when users miss their goals.

## The Science Behind It

Exercise is positioned as the most potent medicine ever discovered—more effective than pharmaceuticals for treating depression and anxiety. The platform leverages this by:

- **Increasing mood-regulating neurotransmitters** like serotonin and dopamine
- **Reducing stress hormones** such as cortisol and inflammation
- **Improving sleep quality** for faster, deeper rest
- **Boosting mental clarity** and sustained energy throughout the day

## Key Features

- **Apple Health Integration**: Automatic exercise tracking without screenshots
- **Dual Accountability**: Financial consequences paired with accountability partner notifications
- **Smart Reminders**: SMS alerts at 8pm only when needed
- **Flexible Goals**: Adjustable daily targets
- **Real Consequences**: Miss your goal = pay $1 more (max $7/week)

The platform addresses the fundamental challenge that while people know exercise helps mental health, they struggle to maintain consistency. Steps provides the structure and accountability needed when willpower alone isn't enough to escape the rut of depression and anxiety.
