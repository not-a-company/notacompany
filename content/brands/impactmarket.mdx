impactMarket was an innovative social impact infrastructure platform that aimed to address global poverty through Universal Basic Income (UBI) distribution mechanisms powered by blockchain technology, providing transparent and efficient distribution of unconditional cash transfers through community-based implementation, impact measurement systems, and pathways for unbanked populations to access digital financial services, pioneering the use of blockchain for humanitarian purposes while demonstrating both the potential and challenges of creating scalable social infrastructure for poverty alleviation.
