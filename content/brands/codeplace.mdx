Codeplace was one of the early pioneers in project-based programming education focused on the Rails ecosystem, serving over 100,000 students before its successful exit by specializing in practical, hands-on learning with comprehensive programs in software engineering, AI, cybersecurity, and Ruby on Rails development that helped thousands of students transition into technology careers, demonstrating the viability of alternative education models and paving the way for modern coding bootcamps.
