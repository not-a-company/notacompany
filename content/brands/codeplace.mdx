# Codeplace

Codeplace was one of the early pioneers in project-based programming education, serving over 100,000 students before its successful exit. The platform evolved into what is now Code for All_, a comprehensive technology education company based in Portugal.

## Educational Innovation

Codeplace revolutionized programming education by focusing on practical, project-based learning rather than traditional theoretical approaches. The platform specialized in:

- **Software Engineering & AI** - 560-hour comprehensive programs
- **Cybersecurity** - 420-hour specialized courses  
- **Artificial Intelligence** - Tailored programs for different sectors and professionals
- **Technology Fundamentals** - JavaScript, SQL, cybersecurity, game development

## Teaching Philosophy

The platform operated on the principle that "everything we teach is thinking about IT" - ensuring that technology education was adapted to each individual learner. This personalized approach helped thousands of students transition into technology careers.

## Legacy Impact

After its successful exit, Codeplace's methodology and approach continued through Code for All_, which maintains the same commitment to:

- **Career Transition Support** - Helping professionals move into technology roles
- **Practical Learning** - Project-based education with real-world applications  
- **Flexible Payment Options** - Making technology education accessible
- **Industry Partnerships** - Connecting students with employment opportunities

The platform's success demonstrated the viability of alternative education models in technology, paving the way for modern coding bootcamps and online technical education programs.
