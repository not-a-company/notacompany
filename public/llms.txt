## About

Still building stuff for Humans.

I'm Tiago Martins, founder and solo employee of not a company. I'm an engineer who believes technology should amplify human potential, not replace human judgment. Over the years, I've been involved with consumer infrastructure brands—building some from scratch, investing in others, and advising many more.

This isn't a venture studio or an agency. It's just me, building and supporting things that help people live better (hopefully).
