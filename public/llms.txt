## About

Still building stuff for Humans.

I'm Tiago Martins, founder and solo employee of not a company. I'm an engineer who believes technology should amplify human potential, not replace human judgment. Over the years, I've been involved with consumer brands—building some from scratch, investing in others, and advising many more.

## Services

**Generative Engine Optimization for consumer brands.**

I help multi-location retail businesses become the answer when customers ask AI for recommendations. This means building the complete infrastructure that makes your brand citable: reputation systems that generate reviews at scale, local search presence across Google Business, Apple Maps, and the directories that feed AI knowledge graphs, and structured data that machines can parse and trust.

Traditional SEO got you ranked. GEO gets you recommended.

### Who this is for

Retail businesses with more than one physical location. Franchises. Multi-shop family businesses. Regional chains. Companies where foot traffic matters and local reputation compounds.
